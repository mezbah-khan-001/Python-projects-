AI-Powered Lock System: A Fusion of Human Intelligence & AI Security
🚀 Developed by Mezbah Khan
🔐 Introduction
In the modern world, security is a top priority. Whether it's protecting sensitive data, securing online accounts, or ensuring confidential access to systems, having a reliable password management system is essential. The AI-Powered Lock System blends human input with artificial intelligence, creating a hybrid security model that provides maximum protection while being user-friendly.

This system allows users to create, store, and generate passwords in different formats (String, Integer, Float) with the help of both manual entry and AI-generated secure passwords. The combination of machine learning, data science, and cybersecurity principles makes it a powerful and smart security solution.

🛠️ Features & Functionalities
1️⃣ Humanoid Functions (User-Generated Passwords)
💡 For users who prefer to create and control their passwords manually.
✅ Users can enter their password in three different formats:

String (Custom text-based password)
Integer (Number-based password)
Float (Decimal number-based password)
✅ The system validates user input and stores the password securely in a text file for later access.

✅ Provides immediate feedback on entered passwords and allows users to reuse their chosen passwords for multiple applications.

2️⃣ AI-Powered Password Generation (Automated Secure Passwords)
🤖 For users who prefer highly secure, randomly generated passwords.
✅ Uses Faker Library & NumPy to generate strong, unbreakable passwords.
✅ AI automatically generates passwords in the following formats:

String (A mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols)
Integer (Randomly generated numeric password between 1000-9999)
Float (Random decimal-based password for added security)
✅ AI-generated passwords are randomized to prevent predictable patterns.
✅ The system stores passwords in a secure text file for later retrieval.

⚙️ System Architecture & Functionality
🖥️ The system is built with a modular structure, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and security.

📌 Key Components
🔹 Homeclass – The core class that holds user and AI password data.
