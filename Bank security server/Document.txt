Project Description: AI-Powered Human Data Handling & Visualization System

Introduction
This project, developed by Mezbah Khan, is a backend-powered data handling and visualization system that integrates human-entered data and AI-generated datasets. The system utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Faker to process, store, and visualize structured information.

It is designed to efficiently handle multiple data inputs, validate them, store them in text files, and visualize distributions using bar charts. The project provides a seamless user experience by offering a choice between manual data entry (Human mode) and AI-generated random data (AI mode).

Features and Functionalities
1. Data Input & Validation
Users can input names, ages, and salaries, which are validated to ensure that:

Names are stored as strings
Ages are stored as integers
Salaries are stored as integers
If incorrect data types are detected, the system triggers an error warning to maintain data integrity.

2. Data Storage & File Handling
All manually entered data is stored in a text file (demo.txt), allowing for persistent storage and future analysis.

The stored format follows:

txt
Copy
Edit
This is user name: John Doe
This is user age: 30
This is user salary: 50000
This feature ensures that user data remains accessible even after execution.

3. AI-Generated Dataset (Automated Data Creation)
For users who want to test data visualization with AI-generated data, the system provides an automatic dataset generation feature using:

Faker → To create random names
NumPy → To generate random ages and salaries
The AI-generated dataset consists of 10 random samples, each containing:

Name
Age
Salary
4. Data Processing & Transformation
Manual user data is processed into a structured Pandas DataFrame
AI-generated data is also transformed into a Pandas DataFrame
Both datasets are formatted for easy visualization
5. Data Visualization (Seaborn & Matplotlib)
After data collection, the system provides bar chart visualizations to analyze the relationship between age and salary.

The visualizations:
✅ Show salary distributions based on user age
✅ Provide insights into data trends
✅ Use customized grid lines and labels

Example of Visualization
Human-entered data chart

X-axis → User ages
Y-axis → User salaries
Graph Title: "Age vs Salary (Human Data)"
AI-generated data chart

X-axis → Randomly generated ages
Y-axis → Randomly generated salaries
Graph Title: "Age vs Salary (AI Data)"
Technical Structure & Class Hierarchy
The system is built using OOP principles, following a structured class-based approach for better modularity and scalability.

Class Breakdown:
🔹 fristcls (First Class)
Handles basic user data
Stores data in a text file (demo.txt)
Processes data into a dictionary
Ensures proper data type validation
🔹 secendcls (Second Class) (Inherits fristcls)
Handles AI-based dataset generation
Implements randomized AI-generated names, ages, and salaries
Ensures data consistency and accuracy
🔹 thirdcls (Third Class) (Inherits secendcls)
Provides user choice-based operation
Offers two main functionalities:
✅ Manual data input (Human mode)
✅ Random AI-generated data (AI mode)
Implements Seaborn visualizations for data comparison
🔹 fourthcls (Fourth Class) (Inherits thirdcls)
The final execution class
Calls all previous functionalities and ensures seamless execution
Usage & Execution
When the script is executed, users are presented with the following options:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
1. Enter your data and visualize (Humanid)
2. Generate Random data and visualize (AI)
1️⃣ Human Mode (Manual Data Entry)
✅ Users manually enter: Names, Ages, Salaries
✅ Data is validated and stored in a file (demo.txt)
✅ A bar chart visualization is generated

2️⃣ AI Mode (Automated Data Generation)
✅ AI automatically generates a dataset of random names, ages, and salaries
✅ The generated data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame
✅ A bar chart visualization is generated

Error Handling
🚨 If users enter incorrect data formats, the system triggers:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
The system encountered an error!
🚨 If the user enters an invalid choice, it triggers a warning function.
